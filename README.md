# Piss and Shit

For public context and understanding, this is a port of the Piss and Shit mod to the latest version of tModLoader, given the original project is considered abandoned. The original source can be seen [here](https://github.com/efcawesome/PissAndShit).

## Missing Features

Some features were left behind, as they either had no impact in gameplay, or just were not worth the time. They are listed down below:

* Music Boxes
* Daedalus Class

## Original Contributors

Credits are all due the original developers and maintainers of the project.
